          Hi my love, my nurse, my favorite sleepy head on duty. 😌
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Today is your capping and pinning, and I just want to pause the whole
          world for a bit and say: <strong>look at you.</strong> Look at how far
          you’ve come. Look at the person you’re becoming. A nurse with a soft heart,
          a tired body, and a soul that still chooses to care.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          I’ve seen you at your cutest, but also at your most stressed — eyes half-open,
          brain fried, hair in a bun, uniform slightly crumpled, carrying a bag that
          probably weighs more than you. And yet… you still show up. You still go.
          You still fight through every quiz, every return demo, every duty.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          You joke about it all the time: “Baby, pagod na ako, ayoko na.” But you wake
          up the next day, wear your uniform, and do it anyway. That’s something I will
          always admire about you. Hindi ka lang basta “cute nursing student” — you’re
          someone who takes responsibility, who shows up for others even when it’s hard.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Behind this one ceremony — this one cap, this one pin — are late nights of
          reading, crying over requirements, laughing with classmates to survive the
          stress, and messaging me “pray for me please” before an exam or duty.
          I remember all of it, and I hold all those little moments so close to my heart.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          I know there were times when you felt like you weren’t enough — like you were
          slow, or lost, or behind. Times when you overthought everything and asked
          yourself, “Kaya ko pa ba?” But look where you are now. You made it here.
          You’re still standing, still learning, still growing into the nurse you were
          meant to be.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Being a nursing student isn’t just about grades and skills. It’s also about
          the way your heart breaks for people in pain, and how you still want to help
          them anyway. It’s in the way you say, “ingat ka” or “inom ka tubig”
          or “kumain ka na?” to the people you love. That’s your nurse instinct
          showing — and I’m so lucky to be someone who gets to feel that care.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          One day, there will be a patient lying in a hospital bed, scared and confused,
          and you will be the one standing at their side. You, with your sleepy eyes
          and gentle voice, will make them feel safe. You will be the person they
          look at when they need comfort. And somewhere in the background, I’ll be
          thinking, “That’s my baby. That’s my nurse. That’s the person I love.”
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          I know you carry so much more than your bag every day. You carry expectations,
          pressure, anxiety, overthinking, fear of failure, fear of not being enough.
          But I hope today reminds you of this truth:
          <strong>you are already so much more than enough.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          You are allowed to feel tired. You are allowed to be overwhelmed.
          You are allowed to cry when it gets heavy. None of that makes you weak.
          It makes you human. And even in those moments, you are still deserving of
          love, of rest, of gentleness — especially from yourself.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Please don’t forget that you’re not doing this alone. Even on days when
          you feel like no one understands what you’re going through, remember:
          I am always cheering for you. I’m the one silently praying before your
          exams, waiting for your “tapos na” message after duty, smiling at my
          phone every time you send a random rant or a half-asleep selfie.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          I’m here for the messy parts of this journey too — not just the pretty
          pictures on capping and pinning day. I’m here for the breakdowns, the
          “I don’t get this lesson,” the “I feel dumb today,” the “baby, yakap pls.”
          I’m here for the small victories that nobody else sees: finishing a care
          plan, understanding a concept you once found confusing, choosing to rest
          instead of overworking yourself.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          More duty days will come. More new skills to learn, more patients to care
          for, more instructors to impress, more times you’ll feel scared but do it
          anyway. And through all of that, I want you to remember this:
          <strong>you don’t have to be perfect to be a good nurse.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Your kindness, your effort, your willingness to try again after every
          mistake — that’s what will make you an amazing nurse. Not having the
          highest grades. Not never crying. Not always being “okay.” But being real,
          being compassionate, and never losing that soft heart of yours.
        </p>

        <p class="line highlight rouge">
          You are my favorite nurse in the making. My safe place.  
          My sleepy, overthinking, brave, gentle soul.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Thank you for not giving up, even when everything in you felt like it
          wanted to. Thank you for choosing this path that helps people heal.
          Thank you for letting me walk beside you while you chase this dream.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          If you ever forget how strong you are, read this again.  
          And if you ever feel alone, remember there is one person in this world
          who will always be on your side — me. Me, choosing you in every season,
          in every shift, in every exam week, in every quiet moment when you
          question yourself.
        </p>

        <p class="line signoff rouge">
          Congratulations on your capping and pinning, my love.  
          I am so, so, so proud of you.  
          I love you more than all your duty hours combined. 💜  
          – your baby, your built-in cheerleader forever 🤍
